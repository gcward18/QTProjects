#Introduction to QT

This repository is a collection of mini tutorial projects for learning Qt. 

Currently there is only one project in the repository which is a simple number guessing game. It's a game that will allow a user to select a number from a drop down box and guess if that number is the same as one that is randomly generated by the game.
